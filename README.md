# Rock Paper Scissors
Your app description, here.


Strategy
- Add a method "start" to the Game class to initiate all the required objects
  to start the game. That way, all that logic can be pulled out of the controller.
- Add a method (maybe "winner check" or "winner?" or "over?" for @game.over...)
  to run before each appropriate method in the GamesController (ie...don't
  have it run before the 'create' method...doesn't make sense to check for
  a winner when the game is just starting)
